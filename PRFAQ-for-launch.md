**Wardley Mapping Foundation launched to promote strategic planning based on situational awareness, appropriate doctrines, and the evolution of value chains**

_London, September 1st, 2022._ A community of practitioners of the Wardley Mapping strategy techniques created by researcher Simon Wardley announce that they have formed the Wardley Mapping Foundation (WMF) to create a global and open mechanism to coordinate and promote the development of Wardley Mapping.

Business and government decision makers need to have situational awareness and understanding of doctrines, the climate they are operating in, and the evolution and diffusion of ideas and technologies.

Wardley Mapping is based on decades of research into business successes and failures and has been used to guide successful strategic decisions by startups, organizations of all sizes, and governments around the world. Maps describe position and movement, and Wardley Maps show how value chains evolve, with guidance on effective use of doctrine to make strategic decisions, compete in and disrupt markets.

Maps in general are simplified models of a landscape, created for a purpose. Wardley Maps are relatively easy to read and follow, but it takes time and practice to build the body of knowledge required to lead an interactive mapping exercise and create a series of maps and associated strategic moves. The WMF was created by a group of practitioners with support from Simon Wardley, in order to grow awareness and acceptance of the methodology, develop tools and training materials, and to endorse events and related products via the WMF brand. The goal is for Wardley Mapping to become a community driven endeavor, that is supported by, but no longer dependent upon, Simon Wardley himself.

_“We used to make decisions based on gut feel or follow the highest paid person’s opinion”,_ said Jane Doe, CEO of Megacorp. _“With Wardley Mapping we can get everyone to have a shared understanding of the landscape and strategic moves become obvious. We’re excited to see this body of knowledge formalized by the WMF, so we clearly understand how to train our staff to use mapping more widely._

_A leading firm of management consultants advised us to outsource our technology platform, but when we used Wardley Mapping we could see that this was a key enabling differentiator for our next generation product line. Instead we used appropriate doctrines to set up rapid agile exploration of new product ideas, while hardening and optimizing our platform using lean techniques, and evolved our operating practices so we could outsource to a SaaS ERP system with minimal customization and six-sigma quality control. We can already see the difference, and are ahead of our initial time to market and quality goals._

The Wardley Mapping techniques have all been openly shared using a creative commons license, and the foundation will also publish content using creative commons. The foundation will create and own the "Wardley Mapping Foundation" brand, which will be used to endorse events, publications and tools that the foundation produces, or that the community decides are aligned with the goals of the foundation.

**FAQ Section**  
Q: What alternatives did you consider?  
A: We looked at several ways to organize foundations, such as those run by the Perl, Apache, Eclipse and Linux Foundations, and decided to operate as a series of Apache style projects located at github.com/wardley-mapping-foundation, with a core set of initial members being committers on the projects, new committers added on merit, and the foundation operating as a brand management entity.

Q: Who did we partner with to launch the foundation?  
A: [we will talk to PerlF, ASF, LF and EF etc. to see what they could offer]

Q: What does the brand logo look like?  
A: We're not sure yet. A kitten with an army helmet perhaps?
